Hey hey everyone we're officially live with the veFDT contest! 

We're v excited to sit back, watch the game and see you guys do your magic. veFDT will be a central piece of an upgrade to the FIAT protocol we're rolling out in stages over the next months. So this initial contest and your work are a critical part of that upgrade. 

We highly appreciate your participation in the contest and stand by should you have any question!

@tabboz and myself are your primary points of contact here but please feel free to also ping @maxfiat or @johannes should we not respond in a timely fashion.

Let the games begin!

Will blocked contracts be able to participate in voting?


[08/13/2022 11:16 AM] maxfiat
We've left that open for now since this doesn't include a gauge mechanism at the moment. It is technically possible to integrate the blocklist modifier with any future voting functions associated with gauges. cc @banklezz correct me I'm wrong though


[08/13/2022 11:22 AM] banklezz
Correct. A future voting/gauge mechanism will fetch voting power from a VotingVault as suggested in Element Finance's Council framework. This vault may void voting power for blocked contracts.


[08/13/2022 1:07 PM] illilli000
would it be possible to make https://github.com/fiatdao/veFDT non-private for the duration of the contest, or somehow provide the deltas of each group of large changes? I'm trying to trace through the changes since https://github.com/mstable/mStable-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/IncentivisedVotingLockup.sol and it's using up a bunch of time


[08/13/2022 2:15 PM] banklezz
You wouldn't find the history in the repo as commits have been squashed


[08/13/2022 2:18 PM] banklezz
It's important to note (verify?) That the core math is in `_checkpoint` which we didn't touch apart from checkpointing based on lock's LockedBalance.delegated instead of LockedBalance.amount. then `delegate` and `quitLock` add some additional checkpoints for delegation and quitting actions

I have this error while testing. 
``` HardhatError: HH110: Invalid JSON-RPC response received: Subdomain not recognized.```
any idea of the cause?


[08/14/2022 9:15 AM] tabboz
could be due to the url endpoint? did u update it or just added the alchemy key?


[08/14/2022 9:16 AM] elku.cryptos
I saved the alchemy api key in an environmental variable called `ALCHEMY_MAINNET_API_KEY`. not sure what else i needs to do to get it work.


[08/14/2022 9:17 AM] illilli000
did you try the all-in-one command?

it could also be links that would help in understanding the finding. Never hurts to be detailed enough when filling the PoC section in the submission. The goal is to ensure the sponsor and judge has no other reason but to mark your finding as valid 😅

[08/15/2022 5:31 PM] Franfran#5067
Why is ` _copyLock()`  used in the delegation contract ? Is that some gas saving ?


[08/15/2022 5:54 PM] tabboz
what do you mean used in the delegation contract? It's used in the VotingEscrow.sol in multiple functions to make a copy of the LockedBalance struct


[08/15/2022 5:59 PM] Franfran#5067
Yeah


[08/15/2022 5:59 PM] Franfran#5067
Why not simple assigning it to a new variable ?


[08/15/2022 6:05 PM] tabboz
got your point, it was bc if we assigned it directly, the 'copied lock' would still point to the old lock so if we then update the old lock it would also update the copied lock, so we initiate a new or copied lock by using the old lock values as default values


[08/15/2022 6:11 PM] auditor0517

How can I get backstage and what advantages do I get?


[09/21/2022 8:24 AM] rvierdiiev
from the docs to get backstage status you need: "1 high severity finding OR 3 medium severity findings OR score >85 on a QA or Gas report"

only in this contest you found 2 mediums
so that means that you need only one more
am i right?


[09/21/2022 9:18 AM] karanctf
what are advantages?

Just wondering why this finding https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao-findings/issues/172 and similar ones like https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-fiatdao-findings/issues/202 where marked as invalid

Realizing that my report wasn't well-written as it was my first contest but I believe that @Respxclearly demonstrates the issue
